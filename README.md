DAR differential backup mini howto
==================================

In my old linux user days I used to backup my machine with
[DAR](http://dar.linux.free.fr). I wrote my expriences into a mini-howto which
you can get here. The source files are in
[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net) format, and there's a
really ugly [Makefile](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) which automates the
process of [spell checking](http://aspell.net), html/pdf generation and
cleanups.
