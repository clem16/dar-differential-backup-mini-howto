Introduction
============

   We all should make backup of our important data. This omnipresent
   advice is usually ignored by most people. I ignored it too,
   until I lost a good deal of important data. Not happy enough,
   I managed to continue loosing data in a few posterior incidents,
   until I decided that it was enough. Then I browsed Freshmeat_
   for backup solutions allowing differential backup and found DAR_.

   A complete backup means that all the files falling under your
   backup policy will be saved. A differential or incremental backup
   will contain only the files whose contents have changed since
   the previous backup, either full or differential.

   DAR_ allows you to create easily a set of differential
   backups. The solution I've developed helps me have an automatic
   backup solution which runs every night. The first day of the
   month, a full backup is made. The rest of the month, only
   differential backups are made. In my situation, very few files
   change from day to day, sometimes the source code of the project
   I'm hacking on, and always my mailboxes.

   The result is that I can restore the contents of my computer to a
   specific day with ease, if I ever need to. DAR_ is a commandline
   program, and it can get slightly complex with a few options.
   This little mini-howto will explain my custom solution, which
   is very crude, but works fine for me (yes, I've actually tested
   restoring the data from the backup). The document is split in
   a few chapters:

   - `Simple DAR usage`_.
   - `The backup strategy`_.
   - `Making a full backup with DAR`_.
   - `Making differential backups with DAR`_.
   - `Setting up some scripts to automate the process`_.
   - `Recovering your backup to a clean machine`_.

   Note that all this document applies **only** to version 1.3.0
   of DAR_. If it works with other versions, you are lucky.

   This version of the text uses reStructuredText (that's
   what the weird markup in the text version is for). See
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ for more information.


Simple DAR usage
================

   DAR is very similar to tar in the number of options it has:
   there's plenty for every need, but way too much for beginners to
   handle. As usual, you can always get help from the program typing
   ``dar -h`` or ``man dar`` after you have installed it. Like tar,
   there's a set of mandatory switches which define the type of
   operation you are doing (create, extract, list, etc), and a set
   of switches which affect the selected option. Just for the sake
   of it, imagine that you want to backup one folder of your home
   directory. You would write something like this::

      dar -c backup_file_without_extension file1 file2 ... fileN

   The output should be similar to the following::

      $ dar -c my_backup_file safecopy.py/ translate_chars.py/
      
      
       --------------------------------------------
       15 inode(s) saved
       with 0 hard link(s) recorded
       0 inode(s) not saved (no file change)
       0 inode(s) failed to save (filesystem error)
       4 files(s) ignored (excluded by filters)
       0 files(s) recorded as deleted from reference backup
       --------------------------------------------
       Total number of file considered: 19
      $ ls (mejorar esto, en anchura y con -F)
      mailbox_date_trimmer  mailbox_reader  my_backup_file.1.dar  safecopy.py  sdb.py  translate_chars.py

   As you will notice, DAR_ will add a number and extension to your
   name. The purpose of the extension is clear, it helps to know
   visually that the file is a DAR_ backup. The number is called
   a *slice*, and this is related to DAR_'s built-in feature of
   splitting a backup over several media. If for example you wanted
   to make a backup to CDROM, but your directories are bigger
   than the capacity of one CDROM, you can tell DAR_ to split the
   archive across as many files as needed, which you can later burn
   to several units.

   Would you like to recover that backup? Pretty easy, type the
   following::

      $ mkdir temp
      $ cd temp
      $ dar -x ../my_backup_file
      file ownership will not be restored as dar is not run as root.
      to avoid this message use -O option [return = OK | esc = cancel]
      Continuing...
      
      
       --------------------------------------------
       15 file(s) restored
       0 file(s) not restored (not saved in archive)
       0 file(s) ignored (excluded by filters)
       0 file(s) less recent than the one on filesystem
       0 file(s) failed to restore (filesystem error)
       0 file(s) deleted
       --------------------------------------------
       Total number of file considered: 15
      $ ls
      safecopy.py  translate_chars.py
      

The backup strategy
===================

   The first step to create a good backup is to determine what parts
   of your system need one.  This doesn't necessarily mean that you
   can't create a full backup, but most likely splitting it in at
   least two parts is going to help DAR_ (or any backup tool) a lot.

   My home system consists of two hard disks. The first hard disk is
   split into a 3.8 GB partition where my complete system lives, and
   another partition of 11 GB where all my music and other temporary
   files are stored, like a local Debian package repository I make
   for myself. The second hard disk has a 9.4 GB partition and its
   only purpose is to serve as backup of the first partition. I
   have no interest in backing up my music, because I have all the
   original CDs lying around.

   From the 3.8 GB I want to backup, usually between 1.3 and 1.5 GB
   are always empty.  I will split logically the used 2.3 GB into
   *system* and *home directories* (at the moment of writting this
   my home is 588 MB). The reason for this split is that as a normal
   user, I can only change my home directory and other files from
   the partitions I won't be backing up. Meanwhile the *system*
   part of the partition remains pretty stable and unmodified
   because I rarely (un)install software. In fact, from my *home*
   directory the only things changing usually will be my ``Mail``
   folder and ``projects``, where I put documents like this one
   and other software I write/hack.

   The basic distinction between *home directories* and *system*
   can be useful in organizations too. If you work for a university,
   usually all machines will have the same system configuration
   but depending on the machine their homes will have different
   data. You can make a *system backup* of a single machine, and
   *home backups* of each computer. Another common configuration is
   having a centralized server which exports home directories with
   NFS. Here you only have to backup the server. If you have users
   with high priviledges, leave them the task of doing the *system
   backup* of their own machines, the exported home is something
   they can ignore.

   Once you've decided what to backup, you want to decide how
   to configure DAR_ for the backups. You can use switches or
   configuration files. Switches are OK when you don't have many
   options. Configuration files are better when you want to make
   different complex inclusion/exclusion rules of what files you want
   to backup, and more importantly, you can use comments to document
   the switch, stating for example the reason why you included this
   or that directory. This can be useful if you come back several
   months later and you wonder why all those options are there.

   For my setup, I'll be running the DAR_ commands inside shell
   scripts called periodically by cron (`Setting up some scripts
   to automate the process`_), so I don't mind having long command
   lines, and this very same document serves for the purpose of
   documenting the scripts. If you prefer configuration files,
   read DAR's documentation to find out how to use them and the
   format they use.


Making a full backup with DAR
=============================

   Here is the full command line I'll be using for my *system*
   backup, running as **root**.  Don't worry about the high number
   of switches, I'll go on describing the purpose of each of them::

      dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R / -c `date -I`_data -Z "*.gz" \
         -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -P home/gregorio -P tmp -P mnt \
         -P dev/pts -P proc -P floppy -P burner -P cdrom

   * ``-m 256``
      DAR_ can compress your backup. The compression is applied
      to individual files, and it can be bad for small files. By
      default files with 100 bytes or less won't be compressed.
      With the ``-m`` switch I increase this to 256, which seems to
      work better for all those little configuration files lying
      under ``/etc/`` and ``/home``. As you see this is a totally
      optional switch, basically for tuning freaks like me.
      
   * ``-y [level]``
      This option activates Bzip2_ archive compression, which
      by default is turned off.  You can even specify a numeric
      compression level, which goes from 0 (no compression) to 9
      (best compression, slow processing). Bzip2_ by default uses 6,
      which is the best speed/compression ratio for most files. I
      don't specify compression level, 6 is fine for me.

   * ``-s 600M``
      Here comes DAR_'s slice feature. The specified size of 600
      Megabytes is the maximum file size DAR_ will create. If your
      backup is bigger, you will end up with different backup files
      each with a slice number before the file extension, so you
      can save each file to a different unit of your backup media
      (floppies, zip, CDROM, etc). My backups are much smaller
      than this size, and I keep this switch just to be safe if I
      happen to create a big file in my home directory and forget
      to delete it. If this switch is useful for you, check DAR_'s
      manual for the ``-S`` switch too.

   * ``-D``
      Stores directories excluded by the ``-P`` option or absent
      from the command line path list as empty directories. This
      is helpful when you are recovering a backup from scratch, so
      you don't have to create manually all the excluded directories.

   * ``-R /``
      Specifies the root directory for saving or restoring files. By
      default this points to the current working directory. We are
      doing a *system backup* here, so it will be the root directory.

   * ``-c `date -I`_data``
      This is the mandatory switch I talked of before, and it means
      to create a backup archive. For those who don't understand
      what follows, ```date -I``` is the shell's backtick
      expansion. In short, ``date -I`` will provide a date as
      YYYY-MM-DD format. With backticks and used as a parameter,
      the output of the command will be used as a string of the
      parent command. This way you can create backup archives with
      the creation date embedded in the name. If you still don't
      understand what I'm talking about, try to run the following
      from the command line::

         echo "Today's date is `date -I`"

   * ``-Z mask``
      Using normal file name globbing you can specify patterns
      of files you want to store in your archive without
      compression. This only has sense if you use the ``-y``
      switch. Compressing compressed files only yields bigger files
      and wasted CPU time.

   * ``-P relative_path``
      With this switch you tell DAR_ which paths you don't want
      to store in your backup archive. Here you want to put the
      home directory (I'm the only user on this machine, there
      are a few more, but they are for testing/system purpose),
      system directories which aren't really physical files like
      ``proc``, other drives you may have mounted under ``mnt``
      (most notably the drive you are putting the backup file),
      etc, etc. Note that the paths you specify must be relative
      to the path specified by the ``-R`` switch.

   That wasn't so hard. Check DAR_'s manual page for more useful
   switches you might want to use. And here's the command line I'll
   be running as a plain user inside my home directory::

      dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R /home/gregorio -c `date -I`_data \
         -Z "*.gz" -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -P instalacion_manual \
         -P Mail/mail_pa_leer

   Nothing new under the sun. As you see, most of the command line
   is identical to the other one, I only change the name of the
   directories I want to exclude with ``-P`` and the root directory
   with the ``-R`` switch.


Making differential backups with DAR
====================================

   Once you have a full backup you can create a differential
   backup. The first differential backup has to be done using the
   full backup as reference. The following differential backups use
   the latest differential backup as reference. Here's the command
   line for a *system* differential backup::

      dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R / -c `date -I`_diff -Z "*.gz" \
         -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -P home/gregorio -P tmp -P mnt \
         -P dev/pts -P proc -P floppy -P burner -P cdrom \
         -A previous_backup

   * ``-c `date -I`_diff``
      I only change the name of the file, cosmetical purpose.

   * ``-A previous_backup``
      This new switch is used to tell DAR_ where is to be found
      the previous backup so it can create a differential backup
      instead of a full backup. The only thing you have to take
      care of is that you don't specify slice neither extension in
      the file name, otherwise DAR_ will make you an interactive
      question at the command line.

   The user command line is exactly the same. Here it is for
   completeness::

      dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R /home/gregorio -c `date -I`_diff \
         -Z "*.gz" -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -P instalacion_manual \
         -P Mail/mail_pa_leer -A previous_backup

   DAR_ has another nice feature we don't use here:
   *catalogues*. When you create a backup archive with DAR_,
   internally it contains the data plus a *catalogue*. This
   *catalogue* contains information about what files were saved,
   their dates, their compressed size, etc. You can extract the
   *catalogue* and store it separately. Why would you want to do
   this? To set up networked differential backups.

   In order to create a differential backup, you need to provide the
   previous backup so DAR_ can decide which files have changed or
   not. Doing this can be expensive in bandwidth if you work with a
   network. Instead, after you create a backup, you can extract the
   *catalogue* and send it to the machine doing the backups. Next
   time, you can use this file with the ``-A`` switch, and it will
   all work as if the complete file was there.

   This can be also useful if you use slices, because the *catalogue*
   is created from the first and last slice. It's more comfortable
   to pass a single file to the backup command rather than having
   to carry the disks of your previous backup with you.


Setting up some scripts to automate the process
===============================================

   As said before, now it's the time to put our backup solution
   under cron.  Place the following executable script for *system*
   backup under ``/root/dar_backup.sh``::

      #!/bin/sh
      
      DIR=/oldg/backup
      FILE=${DIR}/`/bin/date -I`_data
      # Commands
      /usr/local/bin/dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R / -c $FILE -Z "*.gz" \
         -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -P home/gregorio -P tmp -P mnt \
         -P dev/pts -P proc -P floppy -P burner -P cdrom > /dev/null
      /usr/local/bin/dar -t $FILE > /dev/null
      /usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chown .gregorio \{\} \;
      /usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chmod 440 \{\} \;

   Some things to notice:

   * DIR is the variable which holds the destination directory.

   * FILE will hold the path to today's backup file.

   * I use full paths for the commands because my root account
     doesn't have all of them included in the default
     environment. This is potentially a security risk. Ideally you
     would like to compile DAR_ as root and keep your binaries where
     you make them so nobody can touch them. And run tripwire over
     them too.

   * DAR_ generates statistics after each run. We don't want them
     in our cron because it will generate unnecesary mail. Only
     ``stdout`` is redirected to ``/dev/null``. Errors will be
     reported and a mail generated if something goes wrong.

   * The last two ``find`` commands are optional. I use them to
     change file ownership to a normal user, which will later create
     the backup.  Again, another security risk. root should backup
     that from root, and users should backup their stuff. But with
     a mono user system, I don't care. If some intruder is good
     enough to go through my firewall and account passwords to take
     a look at my backups, I'm already screwed.

   Now place the following nearly identical script for differential
   backups under ``/root/dar_diff.sh``::

      #!/bin/sh
      
      DIR=/oldg/backup
      FILE=${DIR}/`/bin/date -I`_diff
      PREV=`/bin/ls $DIR/*.dar|/usr/bin/tail -n 1|/usr/bin/awk -F '.' '{print $1;}'`
      /usr/local/bin/dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R / -c $FILE -Z "*.gz" \
         -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -P home/gregorio -P tmp -P mnt \
         -P dev/pts -P proc -P floppy -P burner -P cdrom -A $PREV > /dev/null
      /usr/local/bin/dar -t $FILE > /dev/null
      /usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chown .gregorio \{\} \;
      /usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chmod 440 \{\} \;

   The only two changes are the addition of the ``-A`` switch and
   the generation of the PREV variable with a complicated command
   line. Let's see what this command line does:

   * First the ``ls`` command creates a list of the files with
     ``.dar`` extension in the backup directory. This output is
     piped to the next command.

   * By default ``ls`` displays files alphabetically. ``tail``
     is used to get the last file with the ``-n 1`` switch, which
     says to display only the last line. Again, the last filename
     is piped to the next command.

   * DAR_ wants to operate on filenames without slice number and
     extension. This means that if we don't get rid of the tail,
     DAR_ will stop the operation and ask an interactive question to
     the user, defeating the purpose of automation. We separate the
     complete filename with ``awk``. The ``awk`` command separates
     the string at the dots, and prints the first column. The result
     is the basename we want to pass DAR_.

   We only have to put these two scripts under cron control. This
   is what we have to type after ``crontab -e``::

      15 0 2-31 * * ./dar_diff.sh
      15 0 1    * * ./dar_backup.sh

   Look up in ``man -S 5 crontab`` the syntax of the command. In
   short, those two lines tell cron to run the scripts 15 minutes
   past midnight. ``dar_backup.sh`` will be run only the first day
   of the month. The other script will be run all the other days.

   Here are the backup scripts for your users. They are the same,
   changing only switches to the DAR_ command and paths::

      #!/bin/sh
      # dar_backup.sh
      
      DIR=/oldg/backup_gregorio
      FILE=${DIR}/`/bin/date -I`_data
      # Commands
      /usr/local/bin/dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R /home/gregorio -c $FILE \
         -Z "*.gz" -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -P .spec -P instalacion_manual \
         -P Mail/mail_pa_leer > /dev/null
      /usr/local/bin/dar -t $FILE > /dev/null
      /usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chmod 400 \{\} \;
      
      #!/bin/sh
      # dar_diff.sh
      
      DIR=/oldg/backup_gregorio
      FILE=${DIR}/`/bin/date -I`_diff
      PREV=`/bin/ls $DIR/*.dar|/usr/bin/tail -n 1|/usr/bin/awk -F '.' '{print $1;}'`
      /usr/local/bin/dar -m 256 -y -s 600M -D -R /home/gregorio -c $FILE \
         -Z "*.gz" -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -P .spec -P instalacion_manual \
         -P Mail/mail_pa_leer -A $PREV > /dev/null
      /usr/local/bin/dar -t $FILE > /dev/null
      /usr/bin/find $DIR -type f -exec chmod 400 \{\} \;

   Don't forget to add the required crontab entries for your user
   pointing to the appropriate path.
      

Recovering your backup to a clean machine

   Yeah.
