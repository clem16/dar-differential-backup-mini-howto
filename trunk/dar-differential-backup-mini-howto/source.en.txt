Introduction
============

   We all should make backup of our important data. This omnipresent
   advice is usually ignored by most people. I ignored it too,
   until I lost a good deal of important data. Not happy enough,
   I managed to continue loosing data in a few posterior incidents,
   until I decided that it was enough. Then I browsed Freshmeat
   for backup solutions allowing differential backup and found DAR_.

   A complete backup means that all the files falling under your
   backup policy will be saved. A differential or incremental backup
   will contain only the files whose contents have changed since
   the previous backup, either full or differential.

   DAR_ allows you to create easily a set of differential
   backups. The solution I've developed helps me have an automatic
   backup solution which runs every night. The first day of the
   month, a full backup is made. The rest of the month, only
   differential backups are made. In my situation, very few files
   change from day to day, sometimes the source code of the project
   I'm hacking on, and always my mailboxes.

   The result is that I can restore the contents of my computer to a
   specific day with ease, if I ever needed to. DAR_ is a commandline
   program, and it can get slightly complex with a few options.
   This little mini-howto will explain my custom solution, which
   is very crude, but works fine for me (yes, I've actually tested
   restoring the data from the backup).

   This version of the text uses reStructuredText (that's
   what the weird markup in the text version is for). See
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ for more information.


The end

   And that's the whole *magic*. If you have problems, something is
   unclear or wrong (which is worse), drop me an email.

   Enjoy!
