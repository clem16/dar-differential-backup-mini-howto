Description: This is a script to be runned from cron which backups
data and stores it locally and optionally remotely using scp. It
decides between doing a master or an incremental backup based on
the existance or not of the master one for the actual month. The
remote copy feature needs a ssh authentication method which doesn't
prompt for a password, in order to make it non-interactive (useful
for cron, if you plan to run it by hand this is not necessary).
