Description: Mikel likes to perform dar operations over the network
to a server.

- make full backup directly over network (slice not possible)
dar -m 256 -y  -D -R /home/me -c -\
  -Z "*.gz" -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -Z "*.png" \
| ssh user@myserver "cat > /home/me/bak.1.dar"

- create catalogue directly on server from home computer
ssh me@myserver "dar --no-warn -A /home/me -C /home/me/catalogue"

- copy catalgoue to home computer

- create diff using catalogue (on home computer only, haven't
figured out, how to do it directly over network)

dar -m 256 -y -D -R /home/me -c me`date -I`_diff \
  -Z "*.gz" -Z "*.bz2" -Z "*.zip" -Z "*.png" -A catalogue
